# ai based financial fraud detection
In the modern digital economy, financial fraud has become increasingly sophisticated, posing a serious threat to individuals, institutions, and national economies. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems are no longer sufficient due to their limited adaptability and high false-positive rates. This study proposes an AI-based fraud detection system designed to address these limitations by leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system utilizes historical transaction data, behavioral patterns, and real-time analytics to identify fraudulent activities with greater accuracy and efficiency.
The proposed framework includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and real-time scoring. Various algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Autoencoders are evaluated based on performance metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. To combat class imbalance—a common challenge in fraud datasets—resampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning approaches are employed. Furthermore, the system incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) tools to ensure transparency and interpretability of decisions.
This research demonstrates that AI-based systems can significantly enhance fraud detection capabilities by reducing false positives, enabling real-time response, and adapting to emerging fraud patterns. The findings highlight the potential of AI to revolutionize financial fraud detection and lay the groundwork for future developments in secure, intelligent financial systems.
